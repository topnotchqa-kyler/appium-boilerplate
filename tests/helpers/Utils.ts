/**
 * Typically, app dialogs are initiated by the application itself and can be interacted with via standard Appium commands. However, there are occasions
 * when a dialog is initiated by the operating system, rather than the app. An example of this is the "Touch/Face ID" permission dialog on iOS. This is happening
 * with `appium-xcuitest-driver` V6 and higher.
 * Since this dialog is outside the app's context, normal Appium interactions within the app context won't work. To interact with such dialogs, a strategy is to switch
 * the interaction context to the home screen. The `executeInHomeScreenContext` function is designed for this purpose. For iOS, it temporarily changes the
 * interaction context to the home screen (com.apple.springboard), allowing interaction with the system dialog, and then switches back to the original app context
 * post-interaction.
